**Why this ?**

I'm making this as an Open source project because, even if Voice changer apps are readly available in market but codes related to it or information about it, like where to start, how to do etc are not that much popular. When i started this i felt so much difficulties, so now if anyone is looking for something like this, they will get a good and easy start.
